"""Guard tests for the Dependabot auto-merge workflow.

``.github/workflows/dependabot-auto-merge.yml`` is pure config: it runs no Python
and is invisible to ``ruff``/``ty``/``pytest`` (which only ever look at ``.py``
files), so the rest of the suite can never catch a regression in it. These tests
parse the workflow with PyYAML and pin the invariants it exists to hold:

1. **It is the only write-privileged, PR-triggered workflow in the repo, and it
   stays safe.** ``pull_request_target`` is load-bearing — a ``pull_request`` run
   triggered by Dependabot gets a read-only ``GITHUB_TOKEN`` that a
   ``permissions:`` block cannot elevate, and enabling auto-merge needs write. The
   trade is only sound because the job **never checks the pull request out** and
   executes nothing from it; ``test_never_checks_out_pull_request_code`` is the
   test that keeps that true. A future ``actions/checkout`` step here would hand a
   writable token to fork-controlled code.
2. **It only ever acts on Dependabot's own PRs, and never on a major.** The job is
   gated on the ``dependabot[bot]`` actor *and* this repository (so a fork cannot
   auto-merge on its own copy), and the merge step is skipped for
   ``version-update:semver-major`` — the bump class where a breaking change hides.
3. **It stays least-privilege and injection-safe.** Exactly
   ``{contents: write, pull-requests: write}``, a job timeout, no cancellation
   mid-merge, every ``uses:`` SHA-pinned, and no untrusted ``github.event.*`` /
   ``head_ref`` / ``inputs.*`` interpolated into a shell ``run:`` step.

Parsing (rather than substring matching over raw text) is what lets these catch a
smuggled scope, a dropped actor gate, a checkout step, or a malformed workflow
GitHub would refuse to schedule — all of which a plain ``in`` check would miss.
