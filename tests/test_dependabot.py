"""Guard tests for the Dependabot configuration.

``.github/dependabot.yml`` is pure config: it runs no Python and is invisible to
``ruff``/``ty``/``pytest`` (which only look at ``.py`` files), so the rest of the
suite can never catch a regression in it. Yet it is load-bearing for the repo's
supply-chain posture: every GitHub Actions ``uses:`` pin under
``.github/workflows/`` (both ``ci.yml`` and ``release.yml``) is frozen to an
immutable commit SHA, and Dependabot's ``github-actions`` ecosystem is the *only*
thing that bumps those SHAs (and their ``# vX.Y.Z`` comments) when a new action
release ships. Drop or misconfigure this file and the pins silently rot.

These tests parse it with PyYAML and pin the invariants that keep that automation
alive: schema ``version: 2``, and a ``github-actions`` update rooted at ``/`` on a
schedule. The root directory is deliberate — for the ``github-actions`` ecosystem
a single entry at ``/`` monitors *every* workflow under ``.github/workflows/``, so
no per-workflow entry is needed when ``release.yml`` is added alongside ``ci.yml``.
Parsing (rather than substring matching) catches a schema bump, a narrowed
directory, or a dropped schedule that a plain ``in`` check would miss.
