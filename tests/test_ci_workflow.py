"""Guard tests for the GitHub Actions CI workflow.

``.github/workflows/ci.yml`` is pure config: it runs no Python and is invisible
to ``ruff``/``ty``/``pytest`` (which only ever look at ``.py`` files), so the
rest of the suite can never catch a regression in it. These tests parse the
workflow with PyYAML and pin the invariants it exists to hold:

1. **It is a valid workflow that wires the local hook gates.** The file must
   parse, expose a ``checks`` job, and run — in real ``run:`` step bodies, not a
   comment — the same four gates the ``.claude/hooks/`` scripts enforce locally
   (``ruff format --check`` / ``ruff check`` / ``ty check`` / ``pytest``) plus
   the ``uv sync --locked`` lockfile-drift check.
2. **The required-status-check contract is pinned.** GitHub names an unnamed
   matrix job's check runs ``<job-id> (<matrix value>)``, so the job id ``checks``
   plus the matrix values ``["3.12", "3.13"]`` are the *sole* source of the
   ``checks (3.12)`` / ``checks (3.13)`` contexts the ``main`` ruleset requires.
   Rename the job, give it a ``name:``, or drop a leg, and a required context is
   never reported again — GitHub holds it pending forever, every PR becomes
   unmergeable, and ``gh pr merge --auto`` in ``dependabot-auto-merge.yml`` waits
   on something that will never arrive. Nothing surfaces an error, which is why
   it is pinned here.
3. **``workflow_call`` stays available.** ``release.yml`` calls this file as a
   local reusable workflow to gate a release on the gates passing at that commit;
   removing the trigger fails that run instantly.
4. **Third-party actions are SHA-pinned.** ``ci.yml`` is the only workflow in the
   repo with third-party ``uses:`` steps, so it is the only one where this can
   actually regress.
5. **It stays least-privilege and injection-safe.** No ``write`` permission
   scope anywhere; it triggers on ``pull_request`` (never the write-privileged
   ``pull_request_target``); and no ``run:`` step interpolates attacker-
   controllable ``github.event.*`` / ``github.head_ref`` / ``inputs.*`` text
   (the GitHub Actions script-injection class).

Parsing (rather than substring matching over raw text) is what lets these
catch a gate demoted to a comment, a smuggled ``write`` scope, a trigger swap,
or a malformed workflow GitHub would refuse to schedule — all of which a plain
``in`` check would miss.
